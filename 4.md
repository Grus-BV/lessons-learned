# Use naming schemes that are independent of roles

## Summary 
This is pretty quick and easy. Wherever possible, try to use naming schemes that are independent of roles, controller or peripheral. 

```
CONTROLLER                PERIPHERAL
SDO ----------> COPI ----------> SDI
SDI ----------> CIPO ----------> SDO
```

This can include:

* SPI 
* UART
* extend this.


## Driving Event
The first prototype of BART had a signal mix-up. Lucky that nRF can map all pins to all roles.
